# Use Spark to inspect data set and parse data
- Data set: log file
- Data set inspection: by first inspection, the data in log file is messy and hard to read
- Parsing with split: build a custom parsing UDF that parse the data into columms
- Create view for sql queries
- Update the types for specific query purpose
